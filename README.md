# project-2 – Time-Based Greeting Script ⏰

This is a beginner-level Python script that greets the user based on the time they enter.  
It uses basic conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to determine whether it's morning, afternoon, evening, or night.

While small in scope, this project represents my first use of nested conditions, input validation, and handling floats — an important next step in learning the fundamentals of Python.

# ⚙️ How It Works

- Prompts the user to enter the current time as a float (e.g., `14.30`)
- Validates the time format (ensuring minutes are less than 60)
- Determines the appropriate greeting:
  - Morning (06.00 – 11.59)
  - Afternoon (12.00 – 17.00)

# 💡 Purpose

I'm using GitHub to document every project I create as I learn Python, no matter how simple.  
**project-2** is the second entry in this journey — focused on learning how to work with numeric input, logical conditions, and input validation.
